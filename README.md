## RE:DO Network - Application Documentation

### Overview

**RE:DO** is a collaborative multimedia platform designed as a modern, intentional alternative to traditional social media. Built on React with Supabase backend, it provides a space for creative professionals and digital innovators to collaborate, share work, and build meaningful connections through iterative creation.

### Philosophy & Mission

RE:DO operates under the principle of "compassionate iteration" - every project, connection, and collaboration is seen as an opportunity to re:connect, re:flect, and re:imagine. The platform emphasizes:

- **Intentionality**: Building slowly and deliberately without performance pressure
- **Mutuality**: Collaborative rather than audience-based interactions
- **Transparency**: Open communication about changes and decisions
- **Non-Extractive Culture**: Genuine connections over clout-farming
- **Gentle Accountability**: Kindness before performance, allowing space for rest and iteration
- **Second-Chance Spaces**: Supporting projects, people, and possibilities
